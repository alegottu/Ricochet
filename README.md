# HOW TO PLAY
---
### Hold left-click to draw walls and ricochet the bullet that spawns towards enemies.
If you lose track of this bullet and it goes out of bounds, you lose a life.
Walls dissipate over time depending on the size of the wall drawn,
and no more than one wall can exist at once,
meaning drawing a new wall while one already exists replaces the existing wall. 


### Right-click to use one of two special abilities:
1. While a wall is drawn, this causes said wall to cyclone and damage enemies in its path,
keeping the bullet in place.
2. When no wall is available, a limited-time barrier is created to keep you from losing your bullet,
as well as to damage enemies on their way in.

You can hold up to two charges for these abilities at one time,
and each charge will regenerate after a certain amount of time.


### Use these controls to ensure that enemies don't pass beyond the bottom of the screen.
Be wary of abusing these abilities;
Drawing walls too frequently, as well as drawing excessively large walls,
will cause you to overheat and take damage.
